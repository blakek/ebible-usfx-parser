# USFX Parser

> ðŸŽ„ Parses [USFX] from [ebible.org] into JavaScript

This project reads a USFX file and outputs a JavaScript object. The output
follows the [Universal Syntax Tree] format.

The output is a tree with a lot of information. It may take a bit more work to
get information than most simpler Bible formats. However, the primary goal is
accuracy of content.

## Why

I looked all over open-source land for a Bible format that differentiated
between paragraphs, verses, and stanza lines.

A majority of formats I found had raw verse text but no formatting information.
Some had detailed formatting information were difficult to work with on the web.
The only project that really met what I was looking for was
[`TehShrike/world-english-bible`]. I wanted more translations, and that project
pointed me to [ebible.org] and its [USFX] format.

## Install

Using [Yarn]:

```bash
$ yarn add usfx-parser
```

â€¦or using [npm]:

```bash
$ npm i --save usfx-parser
```

## Usage

```js
import { promises as fs } from 'fs';
import { selectAll } from 'unist-util-select';
import * as usfxParser from 'usfx-parser';

// USFX files available from https://ebible.org/download.php
const inputFile = './eng-kjv2006_usfx.xml';

// Parse the USFX file into a JavaScript object
const bible = await usfxParser.parseFile(inputFile);

// Example: get all books
selectAll('book', bible);
/**
 * [
 *   {
 *     type: 'book',
 *     attributes: { id: 'GEN' },
 *     children: [ ... chpater data ]
 *   },
 *   ... snippet
 * ]
 */
```
